        / OS X & Linux /

            $ cmake .
            $ make

            Make sure to have libsdl and libsdl-image as
            well as the development headers installed

        / Windows /

            > mkdir win_deps

            download SDL and SDL_Image and drop it into
            the win_deps folders.  You should have a
            win_deps\SDL\lib\SDL.lib afterwards.

            $ generate-vs.bat

            This then generates a visual studio solution.
